# 🧠 Mindreader.ai – "Can AI Read Your Mind?"

**Mindreader.ai** is an immersive, interactive AI experience developed for the **Night of the Nerds** event. This project deconstructs the myth of "magical" artificial intelligence and transforms it into a transparent, fascinating educational tool.

A visitor thinks of any object, and our system attempts to guess it within **a few insightful questions**. It’s not mind-reading – it’s the pure power of data logic and probability in action.

## 🚀 Technical Evolution: From Cloud to Open Source
This project serves as a testament to our technical flexibility and ability to pivot when facing real-world challenges:
* **Phase 1 (OpenAI API):** Initially, the system was built using OpenAI’s models. While powerful, we hit credit limits, which pushed us to find a more sustainable and independent solution.
* **Phase 2 (Migration to Llama):** We successfully migrated to the **open-source Llama model**. This shift gave us full control over the system, increased efficiency, and proved that cutting-edge AI can run on local infrastructure without depending on third-party paid APIs.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Unique?
Unlike typical "black box" chatbots, Mindreader.ai visualizes its internal "thinking" process in real-time:
* **Live Data Flow Visualization:** A unique module that reveals the invisible. You can see the exact journey of your input—from the frontend to the backend, through the logic engine, and into the AI model for probability recalculation.
* **Reasoning Panel:** A secondary display shows how the system statistically narrows down millions of possibilities, visually eliminating incorrect options until only the winner remains.
* **Confidence Meter:** Watch the system’s confidence score grow in real-time with every answer you provide.

## 🎓 Educational Objectives
Designed for a 14+ audience, the project aims to teach that:
* AI works through **probability**, not magic.
* Systems eliminate options using **structured attributes** and logic.
* Confidence increases as uncertainty in data decreases.
* AI systems are essentially **pipelines of structured data transformations**.

## 🛠 Technical Approach
We implemented a **hybrid strategy** that combines the flexibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision of a structured logic engine:
1.  **LLM Engine (Llama):** Dynamically generates questions to narrow down possibilities as efficiently as possible.
2.  **Logic Engine:** Ensures stability and provides the data needed for real-time visualization, making the process understandable for the user.

*This project was developed as part of the **Hackathon Fontys Openlearning** to demonstrate that the world of ICT is creative, transparent, and accessible to everyone with a curious mind.*
